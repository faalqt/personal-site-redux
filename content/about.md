### Hey there, I'm Justin

I’m a “recent” graduate from Plymouth State University. I studied Computer Science while also minoring in General Mathematics and Cyber Security.

I like all things technology and enjoy developing tools and useful things for people to use. I like keeping up with all things tech and trying to code some projects here and there. I enjoy working with the full stack, but keep finding myself drawn to the frontend portion of the stack. In my free time I enjoy doing a lot. Mainly, I play video games and enjoy the different stories and experiences I can get from playing them. However, I also invest a lot of time into researching almost everything technology. Recently, I’ve had an interest in learning more about Audio and Mechanical Keyboards.
