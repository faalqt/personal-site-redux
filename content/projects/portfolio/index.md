This website you're looking at right now was a project of mine to learn a new technology! I had originally made a small personal site by hand, and I was pretty proud of that. However, I was pretty sad about it not being able to have blog-like functionality. That's when I learned about Hugo from a Reddit thread, and decided that I'd redo the website using it. While I would've loved to make my own site using Node, React, and some CMS system, I thought that Hugo would be my best bet for keeping a minimalist website that I can put on my resume. 

Also I get to use markdown, and that's pretty fricking sweet because I love markdown. 

Not really that cool I suppose, but I think it's neat.
