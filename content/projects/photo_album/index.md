This project was a project that me and another student worked together on during our Software Engineering course. 

In this course, we had a course-long itterative project. The project was to create a photo album that accomplished different requirements given by our professor every couple weeks. Essentially, we were given code to start with, then **had** to add new functionalities every couple weeks. The goal of the project was to teach us how to write readable code while also making code that won't break when you add something new or need to change something. We also learned about different design patterns and had to implement ones that we thought would be helpful and beneficial to our project. 

During this project, me and my partner learned a lot about a ton of different things. The first thing we learned about, is the important of communication. Since we had deadlines every couple weeks, communicating which parts we were doing, and which parts we were having trouble with. If we had an issue, no matter how dumb it might be, we asked each other for help if we were stuck. This development of communication was huge for us to complete requirements before the deadline. 

The second thing we learned was how to use GitHub, and the tools that it has. We had a private repo on GitHub (asked to be private by the professor) for this project, and the first thing we did was create a project board and assign requirements to each person. We tracked stuff that needed to be done, stuff that was in progress by both of us, and stuff that we completed.  We also made good use of the issue tracking section. Adding issues we had trouble with for us to tackle and talk about at a later point, this also allowed us to have a paper trail of who did what. 

For this project we used Java, JavaFX for the GUI, and XML for our "database". 

Here's a short (52 seconds lol) gif showcasing the app in action.
