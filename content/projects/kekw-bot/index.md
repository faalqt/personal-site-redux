This was a recent project I created for a fun little joke for my World of Warcraft guild.

There's [this meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDiB4rtp1qw) which got pretty popular and his face has been made into a heavily used Twitch and Discord emote, labeled `kek` or `kekw`. 

So for this project, I created a bot that mimics the [starboard function](https://docs.carl.gg/utilities/starboard/) from a very popular Discord Bot, CarlBot. However, instead of doing that with the star emoji, I do it with `kekw`. If a post recieves more than a defined amount of reactions of `kekw`, then it will archive that post in another channel.


For example, here's a pictue posted by one of my guildmates:

And since that post got past the threshhold of `kekw`'s, it get's posted in the kek-board channel:
